Hi there! I'm Fares Abawi, a research associate and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Hamburg. My work is mostly about making computers and robots smarter and more perceptive, especially in understanding what grabs our attention in different situations. I've been particularly focused on projects like "GASP: Gated Attention for Saliency Prediction" and exploring how humanoid robots can mimic human-like attention and conflict resolution through multimodal integration.

As an advocate for collaborative technology, I actively contribute to open-source software projects (check out [ImageBind-LoRA](https://github.com/fabawi/ImageBind-LoRA) and [Llama LLM distributed with Wrapyfi](https://github.com/modular-ml/wrapyfi-examples_llama)). I have also developed a framework called [Wrapyfi](https://github.com/fabawi/wrapyfi) for integrating robots and devices across multiple middleware including ROS, ROS 2, YARP, and ZeroMQ. To access all resources relating to Wrapyfi, visit [https://modular.ml](https://modular.ml) or the [modular ML](https://github.com/modular-ml) organization on Github.

I also enjoy sharing photos on Google Maps having contributed over 850 photos, with upwards of 2 mln. views. Whether it's a photo of a bustling city street, a serene landscape, or an undiscovered corner of a neighborhood, you'll find it on my [Google Maps account](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103983849206920960820/photos/@52.5146096,3.1303341,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1?entry=ttu).

Thanks for stopping by!
