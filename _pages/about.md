Hello! I'm Fares Abawi (فارس عبوي). I studied electronic and communication engineering before specializing in intelligent adaptive systems, where I discovered my passion for machine learning and AI. After working as a sensor fusion and algorithm engineer, I returned to academia for doctoral research in robotics and AI, focusing on modeling human attention in social settings through deep learning and exploring how humanoid robots can control their gaze by mimicking human attention patterns ([thesis](https://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/handle/ediss/11427)).

I actively maintain several open-source projects:

- [**TeXlyre**](https://github.com/TeXlyre/texlyre): A local-first LaTeX and Typst web editor with collaborative editing and offline support (resources at [texlyre.org](https://texlyre.org))
- [**Wrapyfi**](https://github.com/fabawi/wrapyfi): A framework for integrating robots and devices across multiple middleware including ROS, ROS 2, YARP, ZeroMQ, and MQTT (resources at [modular.ml](https://modular.ml))
- [**Llama with Wrapyfi**](https://github.com/modular-ml/wrapyfi-examples_llama): Distributed deployment of Llama LLM using the Wrapyfi framework
- [**ImageBind-LoRA**](https://github.com/fabawi/ImageBind-LoRA): Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Meta's ImageBind multimodal model
