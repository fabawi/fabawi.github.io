Hi there! I'm Fares Abawi, a research associate at the University of Hamburg. My work is mostly about making computers and robots smarter and more perceptive, especially in understanding what grabs our attention in different situations. I've been particularly focused on projects like "GASP: Gated Attention for Saliency Prediction" and exploring how humanoid robots can mimic human-like attention and conflict resolution.

When I'm not deep into research, you can find me contributing to various tech projects on GitHub, in the hopes of making our interactions with technology more intuitive and effective. Thanks for stopping by!
