Hello! I'm Fares Abawi (فارس عبوي). I completed my Bachelor's studies in electronic and communication engineering, during which I developed a liking for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I went on to complete my Master's studies in intelligent adaptive systems, worked as a sensor fusion and algorithm engineer, and then returned to academia to complete my doctoral studies in robotics and AI. My doctoral research was centered on modeling human attention in social settings using deep learning approaches. It was particularly focused on projects like "GASP: Gated Attention for Saliency Prediction" which addressed the integration of social cues for modeling saliency and exploring how humanoid robots can control their gaze by mimicking human-like attention. 

As an advocate for collaborative technology, I actively maintain and contribute to open-source software projects (check out [ImageBind-LoRA](https://github.com/fabawi/ImageBind-LoRA) and [Llama LLM distributed with Wrapyfi](https://github.com/modular-ml/wrapyfi-examples_llama)). I have also developed a framework called [Wrapyfi](https://github.com/fabawi/wrapyfi) for integrating robots and devices across multiple middleware, including ROS, ROS 2, YARP, ZeroMQ, and MQTT. To access all resources relating to Wrapyfi, visit [https://modular.ml](https://modular.ml) or the [modular ML](https://github.com/modular-ml) organization on GitHub.
